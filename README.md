# Howe

**Howe** provides a replacement for MOTD. Its contents can be customised in
order to provide relevant information about your system.

![Howe](docs/sample.png)

## Installing

Use the [releases](https://github.com/victorgama/howe/releases) to get the
latest version for your platform. In case your platform isn't available, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/victorgama/howe/issues/new/choose) or build from
source.

After downloading:

1. Place `howe` in your `/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` directory
2. Copy the [default configuration](support/config.default.yml) to
`/etc/howe/config.yml`, editing it as you wish.
3. Backup your `/etc/update-motd.d`
4. Backup your `/etc/update-motd.d`
5. **Backup your** `/etc/update-motd.d`
6. Remove all files from `/etc/update-motd.d`
7. Create a new file, `/etc/update-motd.d/00-howe`, with the following contents:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
/bin/howe # or /usr/local/bin/howe, or just howe, depending on how your system
          # is configured
```
8. Ensure `/etc/update-motd.d/00-howe` is executable

## Configuring

Howe contains several widgets that collects and processes system information
every time the utility is executed. Widgets can be configured through the
configuration file stored in `/etc/howe/config.yml`, which has the following
structure:

```yaml
howe:
  - type: widget-name-here
    widget-options: here
  - type: other-widget-name-here
    more-options: here
  [...]
```

### Available Widgets

#### Banner
Banner displays an ASCII-Art (Figlet) using the output of a command or static
text. Examples:

```yaml
  - type: banner
    text: Howe
  # Outputs a static text
  #  _    _
  # | |  | |
  # | |__| | _____      _____
  # |  __  |/ _ \ \ /\ / / _ \
  # | |  | | (_) \ V  V /  __/
  # |_|  |_|\___/ \_/\_/ \___|

  - type: banner
    command: whoami
  # Outputs the output of the command:
  #                  _
  #                 | |
  #  _ __ ___   ___ | |_
  # | '__/ _ \ / _ \| __|
  # | | | (_) | (_) | |_
  # |_|  \___/ \___/ \__|
```

> **Notice**: Figlets will be wrapped at 80 columns.

#### Blank
Blank simply outputs a blank line. Example:
```yaml
  - type: print
    text: Hello
  - type: blank
  - type: print
    text: Workd
  # Outputs:
  # Hello
  #
  # World
```

#### Disks
Lists all or a range of disks. Example:
```yaml
  - type: disks
    disks:
     - '*'
  # Placing a single disk named '*' will cause all disks to be displayed.
  # Filesystems    Size  Used  Free  Use%
  #   sysfs          0     0     0     0%
  #   [=================================]
  #   proc           0     0     0     0%
  #   [=================================]
  #   udev         945M    0   945M    0%
  #   [=================================]
  #   devpts         0     0     0     0%
  #   [=================================]
  #   [...]
```

> **Notice**: Using `'*'` is not recommended, since it clobbers the output.
> Also, `'*'` will cause Howe to be unable to output disk information for
> some users, since it requires elevated privileges to access certain
> mountpoints.

```yaml
  - type: disks
    disks:
     - '/dev/sda1'
     - '/dev/sdb1'
     - '/dev/sdc1'
  # Providing paths for the devices makes Howe to list only provided devices:
  # Filesystems    Size  Used  Free  Use%
  # /dev/sda1    110G  8.2G   96G    8%
  # [=================================]
  # /dev/sdb1    1.8T  289G  1.4T   17%
  # [=================================]
  # /dev/sdc1    292G   16G  262G    6%
  # [=================================]
```

#### Docker
Lists status of provided Docker containers. Examples:
```yaml
  - type: docker
    containers:
      - plex
  # Outputs all listed containers:
  # Docker:
  #     plex:    Running, Up 2 hours (healthy)
```

This widget also allows regexes to be used as the container name, through the
`regexp:` prefix:

```yaml
  - type: docker
    containers:
      - regexp:^pl.{2}$
  # Outputs containers whose names matches the provided regexp:
  # Docker:
  #     plex:    Running, Up 2 hours (healthy)
```

#### Load
Load displays current system load. It takes no arguments.

```yaml
  - type: load
  # Outputs system load average:
  # load average: 0.01, 0.03, 0.00
```

#### Print
Much like [`banner`](#banner), but more discreet. Just like `banner`, `print`
can also take a command as input.

```yaml
  - type: print
    text: Howe
  # Outputs a static text
  # Howe

  - type: print
    command: whoami
  # Outputs the output of the command:
  # root
```

#### systemd-services
Displays status of provided systemd units.

```yaml
  - type: systemd-services
    services:
      - docker
      - transmission-daemon
  # Outputs the status of each provided unit:
  # Services:
  #  docker:                 Running
  #  transmission-daemon:    Running
```

#### Updates
On Debian systems, attempts to provide the number of available updates. It takes
no arguments.

```yaml
  - type: updates
  # Outputs a brief description about available updates for your system.
  # 9 updates available
```

#### Uptime
Displays the uptime of the system. Takes no arguments.

```yaml
  - type: uptime
  # Outputs for how long the system is up:
  # up 2 hours, 40 minutes
```

## Diagnosing Problems
In order to not clobber the output, Howe may indicate problems such as "Could
not read disk information" instead of showing a detailed error. In those cases,
Howe will output the error to the system's syslog, when such feature is
available. In case anything goes awry, do not panic and
[open an issue](https://github.com/victorgama/howe/issues/new/choose)
